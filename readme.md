# `snap-dl`
this project was inspired by [Snapchat-All-Memories-Downloader](https://github.com/ToTheMax/Snapchat-All-Memories-Downloader) by [ToTheMax](https://github.com/ToTheMax). i wanted to recreate their project in bash because node.js scares me.

## install
```sh
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/tg-z/snap-dl
# cd into repo
cd snap-dl
# create ~/bin directory if you haven't already
mkdir -p ~/bin
# add script to path
cp snap-dl ~/bin
```
